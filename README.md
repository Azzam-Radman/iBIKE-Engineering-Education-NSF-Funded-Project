# 🚲 iBIKE Engineering Education

Welcome to the **iBIKE** GitHub repository — part of an initiative focused on advancing engineering education through interactive, project-based learning modules. This project blends simulation, data analysis, and system design to enhance undergraduate and high school STEM education.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **iBIKE** (Intelligent Bicycles for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Engineering) project empowers students to explore:

- **Real-time data acquisition** from bicycle-mounted sensors.
- **Simulation modeling** using discrete event simulation tools.
- **Engineering design thinking** with an applied, hands-on approach.
- **Interdisciplinary skills** in industrial, mechanical, and data science domains.

> 🧑‍🏫 This repository serves as a foundation for instructional materials, datasets, simulation models, and research artifacts developed during the NSF-funded Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) and Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) programs.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Used

- `Python` / `Jupyter Notebooks`
- `AnyLogic` / `Arena` (Simulation Software)
- `MATLAB` / `Simulink`
- IoT Sensors (GPS, Speed, Acceleration, etc.)
- Data Science Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
